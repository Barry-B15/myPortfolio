                <p>
                    I'm a passionate and dedicated web developer who is always excited in building applications that are not only beautiful, but also user friendly and aimed to solve a human need. I recently developed a web application with webpack that uses the Aylien's
                    Natural Language Processor - NPL API to analyze web contents for the author's sentiments. I am completing another app for travel plans. I'd love to combine my zeal for learning, long experience in teaching, with my web development
                    skills to continue to build products that educate, add value, and solve some real world issues.
